Colin's Note Taker

This is my project, where the front end was already built, and it was up to me to build a back-end and connect the two.

Right now, the app is functional, but I haven't done the bonus question at this time, 
which was to activate the "delete-note" button.  The reason for this, is I have to catch-up on other assignments.

I plan to revisit this in the future, at which time I will update this README file.

The screenshot of my app so far (deployed on Render as per assignment criteria):

I worked on this app with Justin Moore (tutor from UCF Bootcamp) and some parts with the learning assistant also
from the UCF Bootcamp course tools.
